1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Focuses on testing individual functions or components to ensure they behave as expected.
   - Example: Verifying that the login function correctly validates user credentials.
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Ensures that components work together seamlessly.
   - Example: Testing the interaction between the product listing and shopping cart.

### Tool Used:

- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework designed for simplicity and support for React applications.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Jest

Jest is a powerful testing framework for JavaScript applications. This guide explains how to install Jest, configure it, and write your first tests.

1.  **Quickstart** :

    To quickly set up Jest, run the following command to generate a new project with Jest pre-configured:

    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest with-jest-app
    ```

2.  **Manual Setup** :

    If you prefer setting up Jest manually, follow these steps:

- **Install Jest and Dependencies**

  Install jest and related packages as development dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom ts-node
  ```

- **Generate a Jest Configuration File**

  ```bash
  npm init jest@latest
  ```

- **Update the Jest Configuration**

  ```typescript
  import type { Config } from "jest";
  import nextJest from "next/jest";

  const createJestConfig = nextJest({
    // Provide the path to your Next.js app to load next.config.js and .env files
    dir: "./",
  });

  const config: Config = {
    coverageProvider: "v8", // Specify coverage provider
    testEnvironment: "jsdom", // Use jsdom for testing browser-like environments
    // Optional: Add setup scripts to run before each test
    setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts"],
  };

  export default createJestConfig(config);
  ```

- **Write Your First Test**

  Create a test file, for example : `__tests__/example.test.js`, and add the following code:

  ```typescript
  import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
  import Home from "../pages/index";
  test("renders the home page", () => {
    render(<Home />);
    const heading = screen.getByText(/welcome to next\.js/i);
    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```

3.  **Run Test**:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
